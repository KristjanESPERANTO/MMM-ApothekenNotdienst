# MMM-ApothekenNotdienst

**MMM-ApothekenNotdienst** is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) project.

Since the data is only available in German, the module is also only available in German.

It shows the next pharmacies on duty in Germany. The data is provided by the website [www.aponet.de](https://www.aponet.de/apotheke/notdienstsuche/).

Why should access to information such as emergency pharmacy services be freely available? This ensures that people can quickly find life-saving medicines in emergencies, improves public health, supports innovation in healthcare applications and strengthens transparency and trust in the healthcare system.

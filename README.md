# MMM-ApothekenNotdienst

**MMM-ApothekenNotdienst** is a module for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) project. Since the data is only relevant for Germany, it is only available in German.

It shows the next pharmacies on duty in Germany. The data is provided by the website [www.aponet.de](https://www.aponet.de/apotheke/notdienstsuche/).

Since there is no official API, the data is scraped from the website. That means that the module may stop working if the website changes anything.

There is also no guarantee that the data is correct. Please always double-check the information before you go to a pharmacy.

## Open Data

Emergency pharmacy services are an important part of the healthcare system. So why is this information not available as open data?

This would ensure that people can quickly find life-saving medicines in emergencies, improves public health, supports innovation in healthcare applications and strengthens transparency and trust in the healthcare system.
